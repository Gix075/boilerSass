Hey Doc, what's the harm of bringing back, er, a little info on the future? Thought maybe we could place a couple of bets. Marty! I didn't invent the time machine for financial gain. The intent here is to gain a clear perception of humanity. Where we've been, where we're going. The pitfalls and the possibilities. The perils and the promise. Perhaps even an answer to that universal question, why? Hey Doc, I'm all for that! What's wrong with making a few bucks on the side?</p>
