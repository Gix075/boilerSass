                    (Main Street) (Doc and Marty are setting up the Delorean for the trip back to 1985.) This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Are you sure about this storm? When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.

Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Watch it, Goldie. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Yeah, I'mâ€¦mayor. Now that's a good idea.

                    (looks up from the TV) What Lorraine, what? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. (Bedroom - 1:00 am)

Griff's going to ask you about tonight. Are you in or out? Tell him you are out! Whatever he says, whatever happens, say no, you're not interested. OK.

Uh...just puttin' on the second coat now! (He indicates Marty's clothes.) You goin' cowboy, huh? (He gives Marty a quick thumbs-up.)
