                Nothing's coming to my mind. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. What, what? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, (George takes out a pad of paper and begins to write this all down.)…tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Uh, no, no, no, no. (Notices that Marty is watching them.) What are you looking at, butt-head?
